For the midterm project, I studied the NHL's Hart Trophy, annually awarded to the league's MVP. I analyzed whether or not the league has been unfairly giving the award 
to centers and disproportionately avoiding defensemen and goaltenders, as well as the effect of a player being rostered on a bad team. I used regression to assess
these hypotheses.

For the final project, I simulated a professional season of my choosing to see if its results were particularly unexpected. I chose the 1983-1984 NHL season to see how
often the Penguins ended up as the worst team in the league and similarly to see if the Oilers were usually league champs.
